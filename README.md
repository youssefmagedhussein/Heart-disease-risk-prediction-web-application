### 🎓 Graduation Project Journey

✅️ 1: **SDLC Process**

I’m excited to share the journey of our graduation project, which followed the **Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** to ensure structure, collaboration, and success.

🔹 **Planning**

We began by identifying a real-world problem—**heart disease prediction**—and set a clear objective to create a machine learning-powered solution with clinical relevance.

🔹 **Analysis**

We analyzed existing heart disease datasets, researched related studies, and defined functional and non-functional requirements.

🔹 **Design**

We designed the system architecture, including data pipelines, model selection flow, and a user-friendly web interface.

🔹 **Implementation**

We brought everything to life: data wrangling, model training, evaluation, and building a **Streamlit-based web app** for prediction.

This structured approach helped us stay focused, organized, and aligned throughout the project.

### 📊 **2: Data Preparation — The Backbone of the Project**

Data is at the heart of every machine learning project—literally in our case!

We combined **4 heart disease datasets** from different sources to build a richer, more diverse cohort of over **900 patients**.

Here’s what we did:

🔸 Cleaned missing & inconsistent values

🔸 Unified variable names and formats across datasets

🔸 Performed feature engineering (e.g., encoding chest pain types, scaling age & cholesterol)

🔸 Applied statistical summaries and visualizations to understand data distributions

🔸 Balanced the dataset using techniques like **SMOTE** to avoid biased predictions

This step was critical to ensure that our models were trained on **high-quality, representative data**. Bad data = bad predictions!

### 🤖 **3: Machine Learning Models**

To predict the risk of heart disease, we experimented with several **supervised learning models**:

💡 **Logistic Regression** – Simple, interpretable, and effective

🌳 **Decision Tree & Random Forest** – Great for understanding feature importance

🧠 **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** – Easy to implement, worked well with scaled data

📈 **Naive Bayes** – Surprisingly good despite strong assumptions

Each model was trained, evaluated, and compared using metrics like:

✔️ Accuracy

✔️ Precision & Recall

✔️ ROC-AUC Score

We presented the results in a clear, user-friendly format inside our app, so users can **see predictions from multiple models** and understand the risk levels.

### 🌐 Finally**: Our Heart Disease Prediction Web App**

We built a web application using **Streamlit** to bring our project to life and make it usable by anyone—even without coding skills!

🩺 **Users can input basic medical info** like age, chest pain type, cholesterol level, etc.
